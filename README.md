## Hi I'm Ivan

I am a research engineer at Databricks Mosaic. My primary focus is building high performing AI systems to solve real-world challenges and create values. 

Previously, I have:
- Worked at Uberâ€™s Applied AI team, focusing on building [multimodal foundation models for doc automation](https://www.ivanzhou.me/blog/2024/11/3/my-ray-summit-talk). 
- Worked with Andrew Ng to develop the [Data-Centric AI campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo) and the MLOps platform [LandingLens](https://landing.ai/platform) from day-one.
- Worked with Percy Liang and David Hall on [Levanter](https://github.com/stanford-crfm/levanter), a [framework for training Foundation Models in JAX](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/06/16/levanter-1_0-release.html).
